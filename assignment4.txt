Web Related Tech Stacks


1. Mean
Due to its numerous advantages, experts consider MEAN technology to be the finest for web development. MongoDB (a No SQL database), Express.js (a backend web framework), Angular (a front-end framework), and Node.js (an open-source cross-platform server)  make up this framework, which may be used to create complex mobile and responsive online apps.
JavaScript is the only language utilized throughout this stack. Its components are JSON-aware and excel at data transport, and it comes with a free module library. This means that instead of reinventing the wheel, web developers may reuse this code throughout the project. Working with this web development technology stack requires only a basic understanding of JavaScript. The stack also aids in the development of software that is quick, efficient, and scalable.

Advantages:
•	Extremely adaptable.
•	Budget-friendly.
•	It is open-source.
•	Switch between client and server with ease.
•	For real-time online applications, this is ideal.
•	It saves time.
Disadvantages:
•	There is a general lack of support.
•	Exploits on the security system.

2. Mern
MERN is essentially identical to MEAN, with the exception that Angular has been replaced by React. The main advantage of adopting MERN is the integration of React and its powerful library, as well as the possibility to use code on servers and browsers at the same time. It also offers fantastic full-stack development (frontend and backend) capabilities. JavaScript XML and Virtual DOM are used in React, and these components work together to implement changes.
React is a popular framework that allows you to create top-end single-page apps with interactive interfaces because to its flexibility and performance-oriented approach. The MERN technology stack includes a robust set of testing tools and is open source with strong community support. In the year 2021, it is the second most prevalent web technology stack.
Advantages:
•	Rendering and performance of the user interface.
•	Budget-friendly.
•	It is open-source.
•	Switch between client and server with ease.
Disadvantages:
•	Not suitable for use on a wide basis.
•	Productivity declines.

3.Flutter:
Flutter, a new web stack for cross-platform development, is the next web development technology on my list. Dart, the Flutter engine, the Foundation Library, and design-specific widgets are the main components. Flutter is an open-source software development platform that allows you to create apps for Android, iOS, Mac, Windows, Web, and Linux using a single codebase.
You won't have to sacrifice performance when creating user interfaces, adding new features, or correcting bugs using it. It is critical to use a stable and regulated software technology stack while developing software or an application. In order to save development time and coordinate resources, the backend must be built with technologies that compliment one other.
Advantages:
•	Toss a dart.
•	Exceptional performance.
•	Popularity is increasing.
•	You will save both money and time.
•	Learning curve isn't very steep.
•	There is only one UI design.
•	A strong community.

Disadvantage:
•	A small number of tools and libraries are available.
•	The file size is large (s).
•	Support for iOS features is limited.
•	There is no support for password managers.

4. Meteor.JS stack
Meteor.js is an open-source website building platform that simplifies developing JavaScript apps for desktop, mobile, and the web considerably faster. It's compatible with a variety of frameworks, tools, and technologies that you're already familiar with. The same code may be used to create apps for iOS, Android, PC, and the web.
Meteor.js provides an integrated JavaScript tech stack that spans the database of the application to the viewer's screen. It means that what can be accomplished in a few lines with one framework may not be doable in more than 100 lines with another. Meteor.js is used by the vast majority of web developers around the world to create scalable apps. This stack has a large community behind it.

Advantages: 
•	Simplicity is the key.
•	Client-server connection that is seamless.
•	Tools for testing in real time.
•	Debugging is the process of identifying and correcting errors.
•	A plethora of packages and libraries are available.

Disdvantages:
•	There is no support for SSR.
•	There are issues with data integrity.
•	There is no native widget library available.
•	PWAs aren't supported by default.


5.Serverless technology stack:
Developing applications on cloud infrastructure is a popular web development trend these days, and it may be very beneficial to you if you choose it. With the services and tools provided by serverless computing platforms, infrastructure management has become simple.
With the serverless technology stack, it's simple to scale up to thousands of people quickly during spikes and then scale back down when the surge fades. Google App Engine, which debuted in 2008, was the first abstract platform to allow serverless computing. AWS Lambda was launched in 2014 by AWS.

Advantages:
•	Cost savings
•	There are fewer concerns to be concerned about.
•	User experience will be prioritized.
•	Scalability has improved.

Disadvantages:
•	Long-term tasks are not recommended.
•	It's complicated.
•	Vendor lock-in is a term used to describe a situation in which a vendor
•	It starts with a cold.
